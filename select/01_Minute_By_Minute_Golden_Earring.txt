From the Album:
* Face it

The first time I laid my eyes on you
You happened to glance the other way
But by the look of your lazy smile
I knew I had a chance some way
I knew there would be - a role for me
To play in a wild wild fantasy
Now I'm takin' it day by day
Cause you got my head spinnin' round
Minute by minute
I'm countin' the seconds down
Until the time comes
For me to hold you in my arms
Minute by minute - until we become one
Here's a man with a hole in his heart
Dyin' to get it fixed
And complications from the start
Make it an operation of high risk
I need an operation - doctor, doctor
But don't cut out my wild - wild - fantasy -
Now I'm takin' it day by day
Cause you got my head spinnin' round
Minute by minute
I'm countin' the seconds down
Until the time comes
For me to hold you in my arms
Minute by minute - until we become one
(Solo - guitar - mouth-harp - fade out)
